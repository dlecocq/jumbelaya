		<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
		<p>Jumbelaya is a Facebook-integrated anagram game, and the basic version is free, subject to the terms of service. Users can purchase in-app upgrades to augment the basic version.</p>
		<h3>Facebook Account</h3>
		<p>Users must have a Facebook account and authorize access to some basic information from their account in order to play.</p>
		<h3>In-App Purchase</h3>
		<p>If for whatever reason, we shut down service of Jumbelaya, any user who purchased in-app upgrades in the 30 days prior will receive a refund for their purchases.</p>
		<h3>Offensive Language</h3>
		<p>Although we try our best, the anagram puzzles are computationally generated and may contain language that might be considered offensive. Through your comments and bug reports, we try to clean up any potentially offensive language from our games, but you still may encounter some. We encourage you to report this to us so that we can improve the experience.</p>
		<h3>Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
		<p>Users who use abusive language in bug reports or comments, or attempt malicious attacks on or using this service may be subject to us refusing service.</p>
