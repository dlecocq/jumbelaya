		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><em>What browsers are supported?</em> - Jumbelaya uses WebSockets, a new addition to JavaScript as part of the HTML5 spec. At the time of writing, the browsers that support WebSocket use are Chrome, WebKit/Safari (including iOS Safari), Firefox 4 Beta, and Opera 11. You must have JavaScript enabled as well. The rest is all HTML5 and requires no Flash.</li>
			<li><em>How do I report a problem?</em> - At the bottom of the game, there is a link, "Report a bug," which prompts the user to enter a description of the problem. From an obscure word appearing in the solution to a problem with interaction, it sends that information to our server along with some information about your browser for us to debug.</li>
